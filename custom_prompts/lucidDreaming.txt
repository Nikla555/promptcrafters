Render a high-contrast, monochromatic illustration in a surreal, hand-inked style, featuring a [SUBJECT] as the central compositional element. The subject should be framed in a horizontal landscape format, lying, floating, or suspended in a position that evokes stillness and internal reflection. The figure's facial features may be obscured, faceless, or distorted to emphasize themes of identity, anonymity, or introspection. Surround the character with flowing, smoke-like linework that subtly weaves through the background, creating visual motion and ethereal atmosphere. Use strong negative space to isolate major elements, allowing crisp white linework to breathe against a solid black canvas.

Incorporate symbolic elements such as glowing halos, mirrored reflections, puppet-like strings, or childlike doubles to suggest psychological duality, self-control, or dream logic. The entire scene should maintain a balanced yet asymmetrical composition, with fluid line weight and no gradientsâ€”relying solely on shape, rhythm, and density to communicate depth. Let the subject interact with surreal objects like phones, mirrors, or miniature versions of themselves, always maintaining a sense of emotional abstraction. The final image should evoke a lucid dream or subconscious confrontation, blending minimalist visual storytelling with dense metaphorical layers.
