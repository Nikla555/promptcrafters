Create a high-resolution, standalone character illustration of a [SUBJECT]  rendered in a whimsical, blob-like vector style. The shape should be organic, soft-edged, and asymmetrical—suggesting playful imperfection while maintaining visual balance. Use a single flat pastel color fill (e.g., pink, mint green, baby blue, or sunshine yellow), with no gradients or outlines on the body.

Add simple facial features: two large expressive eyes (oval or circular, black with white highlights) and a small curved mouth to evoke personality—emotion may range from joyful to cheeky, curious, or shy. The design should convey emotion using only subtle facial variation and silhouette shape.

Maintain a minimalist, sticker-ready aesthetic with no background—just the character centered in frame, surrounded by ample white space. All linework must be smooth and uniform in thickness (used only on facial features), with no shading, patterns, or texture.

Style influences: kawaii mascots, children's vector characters, emoji design, playful UI iconography.
