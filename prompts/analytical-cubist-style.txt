Create a cubist painting in the style of Picasso's Girl with a Mandolin (1910). The subject is a [SUBJECT], built from sharp geometric planes and angular forms. Use muted earth tones—grays, browns, ivory—and avoid strong contrast. The figure is centered, abstract, and semi-blended into a shallow cubist background made of intersecting shapes. Focus on multiple perspectives combined in a single frame. No outlines—use tonal shading for depth. Maintain symmetry, visual rhythm, and analytical cubist abstraction throughout. Keep the atmosphere quiet, introspective, and intellectual.

Style tags: analytical cubism, Picasso-style, early modernism, low contrast, soft edges, grayscale palette, fragmented forms, shallow depth, art poster aesthetic, timeless fine art.
