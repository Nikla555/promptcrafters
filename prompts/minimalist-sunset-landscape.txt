Create a minimalist vector landscape featuring [SUBJECT] as the primary subject. Center the composition horizontally with strong silhouette layering in the foreground, midground, and background. Use flat color bands with no gradientsâ€”rich warm tones like deep orange (#FF6A00), burnt sienna, and dark brown. The scene should feel serene yet bold, with a glowing circular sun positioned slightly off-center in the background, casting warm ambient contrast. Preserve clean vector textures with no linework, and focus on geometric abstraction rather than realism. The image should have a wide 16:9 aspect ratio with smooth horizontal layering and strong depth separation. Style influences: minimalist landscape posters, abstract nature art, geometric sunset scenes.
